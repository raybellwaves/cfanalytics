| The files without any extensions are `pandas.DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`__'s and can be opened with ``pd.read_pickle(file)``. 
| .csv files are Comma-separated values and can be opened with Microsoft Excel® or better yet `jupyter lab <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab>`__.
|
| ``*_raw`` files are the data downloaded from the CrossFit® site without any post-processing.
| Files without the ``_raw`` have been post-processed using this (insert hyper link here) methodology and are fit for statistical analysis and visualization.

| *If you publish anything with this data please let me know and if you like, I will add a link to your work here.*
| 
| *I have yet to add any statistical analyses and visualizations in this package. If you develop any python to code to analyse/plot this data and are happy to share it with me, I will incoroprate it into the package and acknowledge you.*
